# Speed Challenges!
This folder will be dedicated to all of the timed challenges I will be doing! These are all challenges I did in a limited amount of time. 
A full list of the challenges I do will be listed here, including the current timed challenges I am doing.

### Hex Movement
I have done this before, however I wanted to touch on it again because I feel like I could have definitely done it a lot better than 
when I first did it. Also a lot faster. So, here we are. This begun on the 21st of October, 2025. I have one hour to create hex movement. 
The challenge has been completed in 13:32.93. Quite a fast one if I do say so myself.

### Dodging Game

This is a simple game where objects are falling from the sky and you have to dodge them. This will not use any sprites 
as currently I am just practicing for when I want to make a pseudo3d game engine on a timer, something similar to 
Road of The Dead 1 and 2.
