# Speed Challenges!
This folder will be dedicated to all of the timed challenges I will be doing! These are all challenges I did in a limited amount of time. 
A full list of the challenges I do will be listed here, including the current timed challenges I am doing.

### Hex Movement
I have done this before, however I wanted to touch on it again because I feel like I could have definitely done it a lot better than 
when I first did it. Also a lot faster. So, here we are. This began on the 21st of October, 2025. I have one hour to create hex movement. 
The challenge has been completed in 13:32.93. Quite a fast one if I do say so myself.\

Legend:\
BR = Bottom Right\
BL = Bottom Left\
TR = Top Right\
TL = Top Left\
D = Down\
U = Up

### Dodging Game

This is a simple game where there are blue obstacles and red mobs coming and you have to dodge them. This will not use any sprites 
as currently I am just practicing for when I want to make a pseudo3d game engine on a timer, something similar to 
Road of The Dead 1 and 2. The challenge began and was completed on the same day. The challenge was completed in 1:56:09.33. 
I will not add any graphics to this prototype, it is what it is. Oh, also the challenge began on December 26, 2025.\

Legend:\
Left Arrow Key = Move Left\
Right Arrow Key = Move Right\
Up Arrow Key = Move Up\
Down Arrow Key = Move Down\
G = Restart, only when dead

### Hexagon Creator

This is a script that mathematically creates a hexagonal shape on the screen. It is purely visual and has no function 
other than a proof of concept. The challenge has begun on December 28, 2025. The challenge has been completed in 40:21.34. 
It was completed on the same day it started.

### Hex Grid Generator

This is a continuation of the Hexagon Creator script, but instead of creating a single hexagon, I aim to make a whole map 
of them instead. This is also going to be entirely visual without any inputs. In similer theme, I won't use any sprites. 
Only math.
